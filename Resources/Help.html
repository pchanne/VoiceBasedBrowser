<h2>OVERVIEW:  </h2>
<br />
<p>

"Saying is Easy"... With this thought in mind, we have proposed to build a browser operable with Voice. 
This is an attempt to make it intuitive and enhance the user experience. Our main goal is to enable the 
user to perform basic browser functionalities with voice rather than conventional mouse click approach. 
Additionally,  we have also provided the functionality of selecting tabs and navigating to hyperlinks 
within the page using voice commands. Further, as per the user need, the selected content can be saved
as smart notes across multiple tabs or the browser may read aloud the same.
</p>

<br />

<h2>Basic Browser Features: </h2>
We ensured to include all the traditional features available in the standard browsers available in the market. 
Following is a list of features that our browser support-
<br />
<b>1. Multiple Tabs:  </b>

User can add multiple tabs to the browser. User can click on the icon on the toolbar which will then open a new 
tab. We can then change the focus on the newly opened tab and open a new web page without having to lose the currently opened one.

<br />
<b>2. History: </b>
This is another basic functionality which a standard browser supports. 
User can view the history of web pages visited by clicking on the icon which has the History submenu listed as 
shown below.

<br />
<b>3. Bookmarks: </b>
The user can add the current site as a bookmark. The current link can be added as a bookmark on clicking the 
icon,then selecting the "bookmarks" submenu and finally after clicking on the "add" button.
Further, the user is also provided with the option to export the saved bookmarks as a file.
<br />
<b><h2> Voice Commands </h2></b>
<br />
The browser functionalities can be controlled using voice, once the voice command feature is enabled. 
This can be enabled on clicking the icon in the browser.
<br />
